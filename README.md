# Dissasembler
I was responsible for the creation of the fetch execute cycle, running the disassembler from a file and interpreting linux command line arguments to confirm which mode the disassembler should run in. I also took it upon myself to add comments to any uncommented sections of code and do a general code refactor. We ended up receiving a final mark of 96% for this project.
