# Dissasembler
The purpose of this project is to create an assembly machine in C. The basis of the program is to take in binary strings, interpret them into assembly commands, store them in the program's self-assigned memory then executing them in sequence. The program had 3 modes it could run in: the first being by reading in a series of binary strings from a text file before running them. The second being reading in these strings from user input via the command line. The third being by running a hardcoded program.  

I was responsible for the creation of the fetch execute cycle, running the disassembler from a file and interpreting linux command line arguments to confirm which mode the disassembler should run in. In addition to this I created the functions which are used to transform the binary string into usable information to be executed. I also took it upon myself to add comments to any uncommented sections of code and do a general code refactor. We ended up receiving a final mark of 96% for this project.
